### Train 
Use the following command to train the Diffusion transformer model. You can customize training parameters by modifying the file `configs/AISTDshadow.yml`.

**Run the command:**
```bash
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1,2,3 python train_aistd.py --exp_name experiment1
```

### Test 
Use the following command to run the evaluation script and generate prediction images. You can customize training parameters by modifying the file `configs/AISTDshadow.yml`. Currently supports only single GPU inference.

**Run the command:**
```bash
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python inference.py --resume path/to/checkpoint
```

### Estimate Stats 
Use the following command to estimate evaluation metrics like SSIM, MSE, and PSNR. Change the `save_dir` in the script to the location where you wish to save the stats and set the `path` that contains predicted and GT images. Follow the folder structure mentioned in the code.

**Run the command:**
```bash
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python estimatestats.py
```
